# Strix – D&D Character Notes

This repository contains background material, summaries, and notes for my Dungeons & Dragons character **Strix**.

Strix is an Acrobatios Weaver monk, driven by the hunt for the cult that nearly destroyed his adopted family. These files exist to keep his lore, motivations, and story threads consistent and easy to reference during play.

## File Overview

- **README.md**  
  Overview of the character documentation.

- **one-page-summary.md**  
  A concise snapshot of Strix: concept, personality, goals, plot hooks, and party role. Intended as a quick reference for both player and DM.

- **summary.md**  
  An expanded narrative summary of Strix’s life, motivations, and current arc.

- **backstory.md**  
  The full, detailed backstory, including historical events, relationships, and personal development. This file is intentionally long and lore-heavy.

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A personal reference for roleplaying Strix consistently
- A way to share character context with the DM when needed
- A living document that can evolve as the campaign progresses
