# SESSION 0 PREP - STRIX THE WEAVER MONK

## QUICK PITCH (30 seconds)
*"I'm playing Strix, an Acrobatios Weaver - basically a spider-person monk. I was an elven scholar who earned transformation by warning the Araknights of a cult attack 10 years ago. Now I'm a level 3 monk who hunts remnants of that cult. Think: graceful spider-warrior who still asks too many questions and keeps detailed journals."*

## YOUR BACKSTORY (1-2 minute version)

### The Scholar
"I spent 30 years as a researcher at the Library of Velarin, studying Araknight culture and weaver society. Most scholars thought I was obsessed with folklore."

### The Journey
"Ten years ago, I discovered documents revealing a cult called the Pure Form Covenant was planning to attack an Araknight stronghold. I traveled alone through the Bellowing Wilds for weeks to warn them - nearly died doing it. But I made it in time, and they were able to defend themselves."

### The Transformation
"As a reward, I was offered the Ceremony of Weaving by my mentor Moizai. I accepted and became an Acrobatios Weaver - a spider-person. I trained as a monk for years, learning to combine my scholarly mind with warrior skills."

### The Mission
"For the past three years, I've been hunting down remnants of that cult. They scattered after their attack failed, but they're still out there. I track them, gather intelligence, and stop them before they can hurt anyone else."

### Why I'm Here (Campaign Start)
*Work with your DM on this, but here are options:*
- "I've tracked cult activity to this area and I'm investigating."
- "I'm passing through on my way to follow a lead."
- "Moizai sent me here on a mission." (Ask DM what mission!)
- "I'm taking a break from hunting to clear my head."
- "I heard about [campaign hook] and it sounded connected to my investigation."

## MECHANICAL DECISIONS TO MAKE

### IMPORTANT: Choose Your Monk Subclass

You need to pick this TODAY for level 3! Here are your best options:

#### **Way of Shadow (RECOMMENDED)**
*Perfect thematic fit for a spider-person hunter*

**You Get:**
- **Shadow Arts:** Cast darkness, darkvision, pass without trace, or silence using ki
- **Shadow Step:** Teleport 60 feet between shadows as a bonus action, get advantage on next attack
- **Perfect for:** Stealth, infiltration, hunting cultists in the dark

**Why It Fits Strix:** You're a hunter who stalks prey. Shadow teleportation + spider climbing = you can get ANYWHERE. Very thematic for an ex-scholar who now hunts from the darkness.

#### **Way of the Open Hand** (Classic Choice)
*Most versatile, great control*

**You Get:**
- **Open Hand Technique:** Bonus effects on Flurry of Blows
  - Knock prone
  - Push 15 feet
  - Prevent reactions

**Why It Fits Strix:** Solid, reliable, works with any playstyle. Less thematic but very effective.

#### **Way of Mercy** (If Available)
*Healer/support monk*

**You Get:**
- **Hand of Healing:** Spend ki to heal allies
- **Hand of Harm:** Deal extra necrotic damage

**Why It Fits Strix:** Scholarly healer concept, support role

#### **My Recommendation: Way of Shadow**
It's perfect for your character concept and incredibly fun to play. Shadow teleportation + wall walking = ultimate mobility.

## PARTY INTEGRATION IDEAS

### How to Naturally Join the Party

**Option 1: The Investigator**
"I've been tracking cult activity and followed a lead here. When I arrive, I notice the party dealing with [situation]. I recognize this might be connected to my investigation and approach to ask questions / offer help."

**Option 2: The Mission Coincidence**
"Moizai sent me here on a mission [DM decides what]. I arrive and encounter the party, who happen to be dealing with the same situation from a different angle. We realize we have aligned goals."

**Option 3: The Rescue/Meeting**
"The party encounters me in the middle of something - either fighting cultists, investigating a crime scene, or trapped/injured and needing help. After the situation resolves, we talk and realize we should work together."

**Option 4: The Tavern Classic**
"I'm taking a brief break from hunting to resupply and clear my head. I'm at a tavern/inn when I overhear the party discussing [something]. I recognize it as potentially cult-related (or just interesting) and politely insert myself into the conversation."

**Option 5: The Introduction**
"Someone the party trusts (local authority, quest giver, etc.) says 'You should talk to Strix - they know about [relevant topic].' I'm in the area consulting on something and we're formally introduced."

### First Meeting Icebreakers

**If They're Suspicious:**
"I understand this form can be unsettling. I'm a weaver - it's a long story, but I'm not a threat. I [explain what you're doing here]. Can I ask what brings you here?"

**If They're Curious:**
"Yes, I have spider legs. I was an elf, underwent a transformation ceremony ten years ago. It's an honor among my people. Want to see me walk on the ceiling?" [Demonstrate, break tension with casual display]

**If They're Hostile:**
[Stay calm, hands visible] "I'm not looking for a fight. I'm tracking dangerous people - a cult called the Pure Form Covenant. If you've seen anything suspicious, I'd appreciate information. If not, I'll be on my way."

### Building Trust Quickly
- Offer to share information freely (show you're cooperative)
- Demonstrate competence (show off spider abilities in a useful way)
- Ask about their goals (show genuine interest)
- Find common ground (shared enemies, shared goals, shared values)
- Prove yourself in combat (if a fight happens early, show you're reliable)
